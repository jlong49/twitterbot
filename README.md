# twitterbot
A bot that uses markov chains to generate tweets.

Simple ruby script that uses the twitter and marky_markov gem to generate tweets from the tweets of a specific user. Simply add in the username you wish to scrape tweets from and add in your API Keys in the proper place in the code. You can also run it with a -h flag to have the bot attempt to make the tweet a Haiku.
